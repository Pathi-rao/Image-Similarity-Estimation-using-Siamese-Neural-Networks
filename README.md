## Dataset for the Deep-Learning Model
...


## Installation

1. Clone the repo using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pathi-rao/Project_for_Numerical_methods_for_algorithmic_systems_and_NeuralNetworks 
```
2. Create a virtual environment with Python(For this step I will assume that you are able to create a virtual environment with `virtualenv`, but in any case you can check an example [here](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).)

3. Install requirements using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
